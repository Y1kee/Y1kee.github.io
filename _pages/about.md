My current research focuses on **motion planning** for mobile robots, specifically addressing the challenges of **kinematic constraints**. 
I am compelled by the endeavor to formalize physical intuition with control theory, turning abstract Lyapunov functions into **safe and stable** robotic behavior.

In the increasingly autonomous future, I seek to **anchor the high-performing power of machine learning within safe and explainable theoretical frameworks**. 
I envision a world where we can trust the physical intelligence moving around us.

I will be on the job market in 2026, open for postdoctoral positions in academia and research scientist roles in industry.
